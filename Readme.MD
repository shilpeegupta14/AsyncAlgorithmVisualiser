## About this repo: 
This repository shows a macOS based visualisation tool similar to RxMarbles style for the following 5 Async Algorithms:
1) Merge
2) Chain
3) Zip
4) CombineLatest
5) AdjacentPairs

### How to run this repo:
Run commands in the terminal:
- git clone https://github.com/shilpeegupta14/AsyncAlgorithmVisualiser.git
- open .
- Press Cmd+R

### Results:
Merge: It merges two or more asynchronous sequences into a single asynchronous sequence and produces elements of all the underlying sequences into one sequence.

Chain: It concatenates two or more asynchronous sequences with the same element type.

Zip: It creates an asynchronous sequence that concurrently awaits values from two AsyncSequence types and emits a tuple of the values.

CombineLatest: It creates an asynchronous sequence that combines the latest values from two AsyncSequence types by emitting a tuple of the values.

AdjacentPairs: It collects adjacent values of asynchronous sequence and produces elements of tuple (size of 2).
